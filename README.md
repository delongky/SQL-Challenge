# SQL-Challenge

## Background
I was provided with 6 CSV files containing various information on employees of fictional software company and tasked to create a database using these files.  I designed the tables to hold the CSVs, imported them into the SQL database & answered questions about the data.

## Data Modeling
* Inspect CSV's & sketch out ERD of the tables (ERD created on http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com). **NOTE**: Primary Keys are indicated in BLUE boldface text and if Foreign Keys are different, they are shown in BLACK boldface text.  Type-up of ERD is also shown in image, indicating keys as well.

* With provided information, create table schema for each of the CSV files.
*Data types, primary/foreign keys, other constraints are specified.*

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
I performed the following queries on the completed database:
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
